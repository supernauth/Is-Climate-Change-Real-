# Is Climate Change Real?
It has become trendy in Hungary to claim the climate change is just nut present, that it's just a hoax.
I never thought so, but I wanted to make an analysis with the help of the available datasets to see what we can feel during many days.

## Datasets
<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data'>source #1: kaggle.com: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data</a>  
<a href='https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/hu/budapest/LHBP/date/2013-1'>source #2: Weather Unreground</a>

Climate Data Series 1901-2020</a>
The kaggle dataset is quite broad, but it was only until 2013, so I needed to use the Weather Underground's information for the temperatures.
I used the Hungarian Meteorological Service's dataset for the precipitation calculations.
